# eCommerceFruit
This project allows users to "purchase" and "sell" fruits on an online store. 

The setup involves setting up a SQLite database that runs the db setup in tables.sql.

After this database is setup on your local computer you can then proceed to import the code and run it.

Please watch the video in the folder for more information!
